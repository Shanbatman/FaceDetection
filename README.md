# FaceDetection

This project implements a face detection system using TensorFlow and OpenCV. It utilizes a custom deep learning model built upon the VGG16 architecture to perform both face classification and bounding box regression. The repository includes the full workflow demonstrated in FaceDetection.ipynb â€“ from data collection and annotation (labelme) to data augmentation (Albumentations) and model training. For immediate use, a pre-trained model (facetracker.h5) is provided, enabling real-time face detection via webcam.
